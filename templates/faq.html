        <span>1. As a First-time Home Buyer, How Do I Decide Between a BTO Flat or Resale HDB Flat?</span>
        <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer" id="answer1">
        <p>The choice between a BTO vs resale flat comes down to a few factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Check if you meet the eligibility criteria for a BTO flat or resale flat; you will also know this when you submit your HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter</li>
          <li><strong>Price:</strong> BTO flats are generally cheaper than resale units in the same area</li>
          <li><strong>CPF Housing Grants:</strong> For BTO flats, you may qualify for up to $80,000 in grant monies; for resale HDB flats, you may be eligible for up to $160,000</li>
          <li><strong>Waiting time:</strong> BTO flats can take up to five years to be completed, while resale units can be moved into almost immediately</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> For the same unit type, older resale units are generally bigger</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> Resale flat buyers have more unit choices in the open market</li>
          <li><strong>Renovation costs:</strong> BTO flats generally come as a 'blank canvas' which you can customise to your liking</li>

          <span>2. What Are the Different Types of Homes or Properties in Singapore?</span>
          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer2">
          <p>Below is an overview of the types of residential properties available in Singapore:</p>
          <h4>Public Housing (HDB flats)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>2-room Flexi flat:</strong> a one-bedroom unit of about 36 to 45 sq m, with a bathroom, kitchen and storeroom-cum-shelter for the elderly or smaller households</li>
            <li><strong>3-room flat:</strong> a two-bedroom unit of about 60 sq m, with an ensuite bathroom, a common bathroom, kitchen, living area, service yard and storeroom-cum-shelter for households with one child</li>
            <li><strong>4-room flat:</strong> a three-bedroom unit of about 90 sq m, with an ensuite bathroom, a common bathroom, kitchen, living area, service yard and storeroom-cum-shelter for households with children</li>
            <li><strong>5-room flat:</strong> a three-bedroom unit of about 110 sq m, with an ensuite bathroom, a common bathroom, kitchen, living area, service yard and storeroom-cum-shelter, providing ample space for larger families</li>
            <li><strong>3Gen flat:</strong> a four-bedroom unit of about 115 sq m, with two ensuite bathrooms, a common bathroom, kitchen, living area, service yard and storeroom-cum-shelter, only multi-generational families i.e. couples and their parents, or widow/divorcee with kids and parents, with a household monthly income limit of $18,000</li>
            <li><strong>Executive flat:</strong> a three-bedroom unit of about 130 sq m, with an ensuite bathroom, a common bathroom, kitchen, living area, dining area, a storeroom-cum-shelter and possibly space for a study and/or balcony</li>
            <li><strong>DBSS:</strong> public housing built by private developers originally intended to bridge the gap between HDB flats and private properties, the scheme has been suspended indefinitely after just 13 DBSS projects were launched</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Public-private Hybrid (Executive Condominiums)</h4>
          <p>Executive Condominiums (ECs) are units constructed and sold by private developers, with amenities similar to private condominiums, but are more affordable as their land cost is partly funded by the government. They are subject to HDB rules for the first 10 years.</p>
          <h4>Non-landed Private Properties</h4>
          <p>Private condominiums are similar to ECs but are privately owned from the start, with many amenities such as gated security, gyms, swimming pools and sports facilities.</p>
          <p>There are also apartments. Compared to private condos, apartments are typically part of a smaller residential project with fewer amenities but are also usually cheaper as well.</p>
          <h4>Landed Housing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Semi-detached Houses:</strong> a single-family landed residence that shares a common wall with another similar unit, typically spotting similar layout and external appearances</li>
            <li><strong>Terraced Homes:</strong> single-family landed residences in rows that share walls and similar appearances</li>
            <li><strong>Cluster Houses:</strong> landed properties (either terraced, semi-detached or bungalows) built in a cluster with shared communal amenities such as gyms and swimming pools</li>
            <li><strong>Townhouses:</strong> a spacious and private terraced home that shares communal facilities such as gyms and swimming pools with residents of other units</li>
            <li><strong>Shophouses:</strong> prized for their heritage and historical importance, these are terraced housing with the first floor meant for commercial purposes while the upper floors can be used as offices, hotels or residences</li>
            <li><strong>Bungalows:</strong> a one or two-storey stand-alone home of 400 to 1,400 sq m that does not share a wall with other units</li>
            <li><strong>Good Class Bungalows (GCB):</strong> a bungalow but much bigger, with a land area over 1,400 sq m and luxuriously decked out with huge gardens, swimming pools and other amenities</li>
          </ul>

          <span>3. What's the Difference Between Freehold Vs Leasehold Property in Singapore?</span>
          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer3">
          <p>The common understanding is that freehold properties can be held indefinitely by the buyer, while 99-year leasehold properties will revert back to the state after the tenure ends. Freehold units generally carry a higher value and have theoretical advantages, while leasehold units have been shown to offer better rental yields. As the remaining lease period gets shorter, bank loans may also be harder to get approved, and CPF money cannot be used to buy a home with less than 30 years of lease remaining.</p>
          <p>To complicate matters, this freehold vs leasehold comparison is muddied by many long-held myths and misconceptions. Avoiding these, what it boils down to is the intention of the buyer. Choose freehold if you plan to live in the property for the long term; while leasehold makes more sense for rental income.</p>

To avoid a pre-payment penalty, you will want to ensure you're not refinancing your home loan within your lock-in period. The penalty is usually 1.5% of the outstanding loan.</p>

            <li><strong>Funding:</strong> The LTV limit that you can borrow from banks will vary depending on your existing properties and mortgages. Your TDSR cannot exceed 55%. These factors will determine the maximum property value that you can potentially buy</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> This greatly determines the future prospect of the property you are buying. Ask several property agents and research the price statistics of different areas on the HDB and URA websites to help you decide whether a location is worth your investment</li>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer16">
          <p>In Singapore, sellers of residential properties need to be aware of Seller's Stamp Duty (SSD), which is a tax on properties sold within the first three years of purchase. This starts at 12% if sold in the first year of purchase, 8% in the second year, and 4% in the third year. You can avoid this penalty if you wait to sell your property in the fourth year, while renting out the space in the meantime.</p>
          <p>That said, when to sell also depends on whether the price is right (i.e. has the initial price investment "matured"). Sometimes, it may be more prudent to hold a property as development of the estate or area is still ongoing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer17">
          <p>An "en bloc" sale is a term for the collective sale of two or more property units to a single purchaser. In Singapore, en bloc is commonly used to refer to full-development sales to a property developer or the government.</p>
          <p>In essence, it means the property owners agree to collectively sell their units in exchange for payment. This payment is usually higher than the current market price of each individual unit as it removes the hassle and risk of the buyer having to negotiate with each individual owner.</p>
          <p>For an en bloc deal to go through, at least 80% of the residents (based on property value and strata area) must agree to the sale if the development is more than 10 years old. 90% must agree if the development is 10 years old or below.</p>

          <span>19. Can Singapore PRs Buy HDB Flats in Singapore?</span>
          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer19">
          <p>If you're talking about an HDB flat directly purchased from HDB (i.e. a BTO flat or SBF flat), a single PR (i.e. a PR buying without a Singapore citizen) is not permitted to purchase such property. The only way for a PR to legally buy a new HDB flat is by marrying a Singapore Citizen. If you already tied the knot with a Singapore Citizen, both of you can acquire a BTO flat via the HDB Public Scheme or the Fianc√©/Fianc√©e Scheme.</p>
          <p>If you're just two Singapore PRs forming a household together, you also cannot buy new, subsidised HDB flats sold by the government. But you can buy a resale flat with another Singapore PR. But both of you must have at least attained the PR status for at least three years. A single PR also cannot purchase a resale HDB flat on his/her own.</p>
          <p>To find out more about your HDB flat eligibility, you can read our article. Alternatively, if you do want to buy an HDB flat, you can find out your HDB flat purchase eligibility when you apply for your HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter.</p>

          <span>20. What Are the Rules for Buying a Second Property in Singapore?</span>
          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer20">
          <p>Singapore Citizens who own an HDB flat, DBSS flat or new EC must fulfil the five-year MOP before they are eligible to buy a private property.</p>
          <p>Singapore Permanent Residents cannot own both an HDB flat and private residential property at the same time. They will need to dispose of a unit within six months of making the new purchase. Only Singapore Citizens are allowed to own an HDB flat and private property at the same time.</p>
          <p>For those eligible, you should be aware of a few things that differ from your first property purchase. Assuming you are intending to hold both properties at the same time:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your LTV limit for your second home loan will be lower than that of your first home loan. This means you'll need to have sufficient cash on hand to make up the remainder</li>
            <li>The minimum cash downpayment for your second property can go up to 25%. Again, do be prepared and have the required cash reserves</li>
            <li>You'll have to pay ABSD on top of the regular BSD. For Singapore citizens buying their second property, the ABSD amount is 20%; for PRs buying their second property, the ABSD amount is 30%</li>

          <span>21. Can I Use CPF for the Downpayment of My House?</span>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer21">
          <p>Yes, you can! Depending on what type of loan you take, the amount of downpayment that you can pay with your CPF varies. Assuming you're buying your first flat and have secured a loan with the maximum LTV limit:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>New or resale HDB flat using an HDB loan:</strong> 20% downpayment can be made in full using CPF savings</li>
            <li><strong>Private property, or new or resale HDB flat using a bank loan:</strong> 25% downpayment, of which at least 5% must be in cash; the remaining 20% can be paid via CPF and/or cash</li>

          <p>Yes, you can use your CPF Ordinary Account to finance your home loans.
